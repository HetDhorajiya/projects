        <h2>step for cook Super-Delicious Zuppa Toscana</h2>
        <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and
            no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.

        </li>
        <li>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few
            tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook
            until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about
            20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach
            has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.
